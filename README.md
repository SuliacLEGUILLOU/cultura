## Cultura bot

Cultura bot gets a random wikipedia article and post his summary on mastodon.

## How to use it

It work with python3.
I summon it with cron every hour.

Copy your credential information in a credential.py file (exemple is given)
You need then to copy the application client id in pytooter_clientcred.secret and you application secret in pytooter_usercred.secret

They can be generated and found in your account developper setting
